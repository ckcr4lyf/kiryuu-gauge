# Announce

For all tests, we will use an infohash which can be ASCII represented easily, 
e.g. [0x41; 20] , which would be AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA as the raw bytes

Recall the hex string is used in redis, and the % URL encoded bytes in GET param

## Should get seeders correctly

* Seed redis with seeders
* Announce should have expected seeders
